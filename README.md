# Application Profiles for the Description of IT Systems

Information about public-sector IT systems is exchanged in many different contexts and for many different purposes, and this provides interest and motivation for standardizing the way IT systems are described in order to support higher reuse and quality of data about IT systems.

This page document two drafts for application profiles for use in the context of the Danish public-sector.  

## A Basic Application Profile 
This application profile constitutes a Danish public-sector specification for describing the cores properties of public-sector IT systems.

## An Archive Application Profile (go to branch archvSYS-AP)
This application profile reuses core elements from the basic aplication profile above, but extends this with classes and properties relevant for in relation to submitting information about IT system Details to the National Archives.
